```
cd path/to/workspace/findmycook-backend

**Set up your database**

* Create a new directory where your database will be stored (it's a good idea to separate data and business logic - the data directory should be on a different place than your app)
* Start the database server
```
mongod --dbpath relative/path/to/database
```
* Create all database schemes and import data to begin with
```
mongorestore dump/
```

**Set the environment variables**

This variables are based in your local configuration

## Code of Conduct

### Git Workflow
Please use feature branches only to commit your code. 

After finishing your feature, create a pull request and add one reviewer.

The reviewer needs to make sure that the features committed are working without errors before approving.

The reviewer shall merge the feature branch into the develop branch once they approved the pull request.

The master branch is only used for production, i.e. a finished deliverable/ work product.
